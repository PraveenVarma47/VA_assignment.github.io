        <h2>My Introduction</h2>
        <p>I'm a computer science student with a strong foundation in programming languages, algorithms, and data structures.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from GITAM Vizag, India.</p>

        <h4>Projects</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Weather Prediction:
                This ML-based project is aimed to predict the future weather using Neural Network models, based on different 
                input parameters. The project consists of data transformation, data cleaning, data visualization, and predictive 
                model building using Neural Networks.
            </li>

            <li>
                Currency Detector for Visually Impaired: 
                This project helps visually impaired patients to recognize and detect money. Implemented concepts like text to 
                speech, to read and covert values into speech to the user. Used custom vision API from Microsoft Azure for 
                machine learning techniques to detect currency from images taken in mobile camera.
            </li>

            <li>
                Facial Recognition:
                This Machine Learning project is designed to detect a person in a group or an image. It is built with the help of 
                Dlibâ€™s (a c++ toolkit containing ML algorithms) face recognition. The accuracy of this model is around 90%.
